                <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD Projekt.
                    It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the third game in The
                    Witcher video game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective. The games follow
                    The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. </p>
                <p>The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players control Geralt
                    of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted daughter, who is
                    on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and
                    magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience points and
                    gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story has
                    three possible endings, determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative. </p>
                <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective. Players
                    control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher.[1] Geralt walks, runs, rolls and
                    dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims.[2][3] He has a variety of
                    weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).[4] The steel sword
                    is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and
                    monsters.[5] Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of
                    melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow but strong.[6] Players can
                    block and counter enemy attacks with their swords.[4] Swords have limited endurance and require
                    regular repair. </p>

                <p>The game begins with Geralt's dream about Kaer Morhen, a demolished witcher school. Yennefer, a
                    sorceress and his love interest, notifies Geralt of Ciri, a young female witcher in training and
                    their adopted daughter, practicing without his permission. Geralt finds Ciri and brings her back to
                    Vesemir, her teacher. However, the titular Wild Hunt, a phantom army whose appearance is the
                    beginning of the end of the world, kidnaps Ciri. While Geralt wakes up, he realizes that it was just
                    a bad dream and he is still on a journey to find Yennefer with his mentor Vesemir. </p>
                <p>While trying to find Yennefer in the Temerian village of White Orchard, Geralt comes in contact with
                    Nilfgaardian commander named Peter Saar Gwynlew who tasks him into hunting down a Griffin in
                    exchange for Yennefer's location. Yennefer finds Geralt and Vesemir after an incident in the tavern
                    and tells Geralt that Emhyr var Emeris, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, has summoned him to Vizima, the
                    capital of Temeria occupied by Nilfgaard. Along the way to Vizima, Geralt and Yennefer are ambushed
                    by the Wild Hunt but Yennefer successfully teleports them away. In Vizima, Emhyr tasks Geralt to
                    find the emperor's biological daughter, Ciri, who has returned with the Wild Hunt, the phantom army
                    that intends to capture her and extract her Elder Blood powers.
                </p>
                <p>In Velen, Geralt finds the Nilfgaardian spy he was supposed to contact tortured to death by the Hunt.
                    The spy's notes lead Geralt to Philip Stenger, known as the Bloody Baron, who tasks Geralt to find
                    his wife and daughter in exchange for information on Ciri. After learning of the Baron's abuse of
                    his wife and dealing with a botchling of the Baron's miscarried child, the search leads to a
                    fisherman who saw the wife get taken by a Fiend with the daughter escaping to Oxenfurt. Geralt meets
                    an old acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, who leads him to the Ladies of the Wood in the Crookback
                    Bog after running into the Hunt in an ancient elven laboratory. After meeting "Gran" who takes care
                    of the orphans in the bog, Geralt meets the Crones of the Crookback Bog and completes a task for
                    them, dealing with the Whispering Hollock, in exchange for Ciri's whereabouts
                </p>
                <p>In Novigrad, Geralt meets with Triss Merigold who instructs him to visit an Oneiromancer, Corinne
                    Tilly, who can interpret dreams. This leads Geralt to find Whoreson Junior and rescue Dandelion, who
                    was captured after a failed heist. Geralt finds Junior through the help of Sigismund Djikstra and
                    King Radovid, who used Junior as a spy in Novigrad. Geralt and Zoltan Chivay rescue Dandelion from
                    the Witch Hunters, with the help of a doppler named Dudu and Priscilla, a trobairitz who is
                    Dandelion's love interest.
                </p>
                <p>Summing up the clues, Geralt leaves in search of Uma, the monstrous baby looking creature who may be
                    the key to finding Ciri. After collecting him from the Bloody Baron's (or his men) who won the
                    creature from a skellige merchant, Geralt takes him to Kaer Morhen after seeing Emyhr in Vizima.
                    There Yennefer and the Witchers help lift the curse on Uma by administering the potions of the
                    infamous Trial of Grasses. Uma transforms into Avallac'h, an Aen Elle elf, from the race Eredin,
                    king of the Hunt, and the Hunt itself are from. Avallac'h reveals that he hid Ciri in the Isle of
                    Mists. Geralt plans to bring her to Kaer Morhen so they can stand against the Wild Hunt when they
                    come after her. After recruiting allies for this fight, Geralt then heads for the Isle of Mists. He
                    finds Ciri in a death like state, looked after by some dwarves. While grieving her "death",
                    Avallac'h's guide awakens her in Geralt's arms. </p>
